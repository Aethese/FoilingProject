# FoilingProject
Just a simple challenge between me and a friend to make a foiling system.
My idiot friends repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Aethese/Foiling)

Currently, it supports basic foiling but im working on support for complex foiling which includes variables.

# Limitations
Currently, it can't do negative numbers, but I will fix this soon.

Algebraic functions are also not supported yet, but I am working on that.
